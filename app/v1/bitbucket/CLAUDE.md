# Bitbucket module — developer notes

## How the client is built

`main.py` constructs a single `BaseAPI` client with basic auth from `global_config`:

```
BaseAPI(global_config.BITBUCKET_API_URL, auth=(global_config.BITBUCKET_USERNAME, global_config.BITBUCKET_PASSWORD)).client
```

Passed into `get_v1_bitbucket_router(bitbucket_client)` at startup — no per-request reconstruction.

## Routes

| Method | Path | Operation |
|--------|------|-----------|
| `POST` | `/` | Create project + assign admin (user and/or group) |
| `DELETE` | `/{key}` | Delete project |
| `GET` | `/user-dirs` | List user directories |
| `POST` | `/user-dirs/sync` | Sync the single user directory (ID auto-discovered) |

> Route paths above are devops-api's own; the upstream Bitbucket endpoints they call are `/rest/crowd/latest/directory` (see below).

## Project create flow (POST /)

```
validate_admin_principals         ← fails here if user/group not found; project is never created
  → _assert_user_exists           [if admin_user set]
  → _assert_group_exists          [if admin_group set]
create_project
  → assign_admin_permission       [if admin_user set]
  → assign_admin_group_permission [if admin_group set]
```

`admin_user` and `admin_group` are mutually non-exclusive — at least one must be provided, and
both can be set together (assigns both a user and a group admin).

**2026-07-20 — `validate_admin_principals` is now actually implemented** (`operations.py`).
This flow diagram used to describe an aspirational design with no code behind it — confirmed via
`grep` across the module, zero hits outside this doc. Found while writing additional test
coverage for this module; now matches reality: `_assert_user_exists`/`_assert_group_exists` call
`GET .../admin/users?filter=`/`GET .../admin/groups?filter=` and raise `404` if the `values`
array comes back empty, *before* `create_project` runs.

On unexpected failure after project creation: rollback via `delete_project(key)`. The rollback
itself is wrapped in its own try/except — a failed rollback is logged, not raised, so it can
never mask or crash past the original error. The route always returns a proper `500`
`ExceptionResponse` on this path now; it used to fall through with no `return` at all (the
existing unit test for this path never asserted on the response, which is how that went
unnoticed until now).

## Bitbucket REST API calls

### Create project — `POST /rest/api/latest/projects`

```
POST /rest/api/latest/projects
Body: {"key": key, "name": name, "description": description, "public": false}
→ 201
```

Projects are always created as private (`public: false` is hardcoded — the field is not exposed to callers).

### Delete project — cascades repo deletion first

Bitbucket **refuses to delete a project that still contains repositories** — confirmed live:
`DELETE /rest/api/latest/projects/{key}` on a project with any repo inside returns `409` with
`{"errors":[{"message":"The project \"{key}\" cannot be deleted because it has repositories.",
"exceptionName":"com.atlassian.bitbucket.IntegrityException"}]}`. This is unrelated to repo
size — it happens even for a project containing a single empty repo.

`delete_project` therefore lists all repos under the project first and deletes each one
before deleting the project itself:

```
GET    /rest/api/latest/projects/{key}/repos?start={start}&limit=100   (paginated via list_repos)
  → {"values": [{"slug": ..., ...}], "isLastPage": bool, "nextPageStart": int}
DELETE /rest/api/latest/projects/{key}/repos/{repo_slug}    for each repo
  → 202 (Accepted — confirmed live this is genuinely asynchronous under the hood; Bitbucket
     purges the underlying git data in the background)
DELETE /rest/api/latest/projects/{key}
  → 204
```

No polling is needed between the repo deletes and the project delete: confirmed live with a
real 200MB git repo — even though the repo delete itself returns `202`, an immediate `GET` on
that repo already 404s, and the project delete that follows immediately succeeds with `204`.
Bitbucket's REST-visible state (both repo and project) flips to "gone" synchronously with the
API response; only the actual on-disk data purge happens asynchronously in the background.

### Delete project — no lag on the project delete itself, confirmed at scale

`DELETE /rest/api/latest/projects/{key}` (once the project has no repos left) returns `204`,
and immediate `GET`s on the same project 404 right away — confirmed live with up to 20
consecutive immediate polls, both against an empty project and one that previously held a
200MB repo. Unlike Confluence's space delete (see `app/v1/confluence/CLAUDE.md`), there is no
accepted-but-not-yet-gone race here, so `delete_project` does not poll for confirmation.

### Assign user admin — pre-check + `PUT`

```
# 1. Pre-check: confirm user exists
GET /rest/api/latest/admin/users?filter={admin_user}
→ 200, values array; raises 404 "User '{admin_user}' does not exist in Bitbucket" if not found

# 2. Assign permission
PUT /rest/api/latest/projects/{key}/permissions/users?name={admin_user}&permission=PROJECT_ADMIN
→ 204
```

### Assign group admin — pre-check + `PUT`

```
# 1. Pre-check: confirm group exists
GET /rest/api/latest/admin/groups?filter={admin_group}
→ 200, values array; raises 404 "Group '{admin_group}' does not exist in Bitbucket" if not found

# 2. Assign permission
PUT /rest/api/latest/projects/{key}/permissions/groups?name={admin_group}&permission=PROJECT_ADMIN
→ 204
```

### List user directories — `GET /rest/crowd/latest/directory`

```
GET /rest/crowd/latest/directory
Header: Accept: application/json
→ 200, {"directory": [{"name": ..., "link": [{"href": "https://.../directory/{id}", "rel": "self"}], "synchronisation"?: {...}}, ...]}
```

Confirmed live against Bitbucket Data Center 10.2.2 with a real AD-connected directory.
`GET /rest/api/1.0/admin/user-directories` (the Bitbucket-native admin REST API) also works
and returns a friendlier `{"name", "type", "isActive", "description"}` shape, but **never
exposes an id field at all** — not even embedded in a link — so it cannot support the sync
operation below. Bitbucket shares the same Atlassian Crowd-embedded REST resource Jira and
Confluence use (see `app/v1/jira/CLAUDE.md`, `app/v1/confluence/CLAUDE.md`); its shape
matches Confluence's exactly (`directory`/`link`, singular), not Jira's (`directories`/
`links`, plural) — same underlying module, inconsistent JSON key pluralization across
products. Neither response includes an `id` field on each directory object; the numeric ID
only exists embedded in `link[0].href` (e.g. `.../directory/32769` → `32769`), which is what
`sync_user_directory` parses out.

### Sync user directory — unsupported, `sync_user_directory` always raises `501`

Bitbucket Data Center has **no supported way to trigger a directory sync on demand**, at all.
This was investigated thoroughly live against Bitbucket Data Center 10.2.2 before concluding
that (see git history for the full back-and-forth):

1. `POST /rest/crowd/latest/directory/{id}/synchronise` — the path Jira/Confluence use
   successfully for the same shared Crowd-embedded resource — **404s on Bitbucket even with
   the correct connector directory ID**. Confirmed on a real AD-connector directory, not a
   guess against the wrong directory.
2. `POST /rest/api/1.0/admin/user-directories/{id}/sync` (the old, wrong path this code used
   to call) also 404s with a real ID.
3. The Bitbucket **web UI** does have a working "Synchronize" action, found by fetching the
   admin console HTML directly: `POST /plugins/servlet/embedded-crowd/directories/sync?directoryId={id}`.
   This is an internal servlet, not a documented/versioned REST endpoint. It accepts Basic
   Auth and always returns `302` — but **that response is not a reliable success signal**:
   - The first live test appeared to work (directory's `lastStartTime` advanced).
   - Every subsequent call — verified independently via tight API polling (`currentStartTime`
     never went non-zero, `lastStartTime` never advanced, over 90+ seconds) **and** by
     visually checking the Bitbucket admin UI directly — produced **zero effect**, despite
     an identical `302` response each time.
   - Conclusion: the one apparent success coincided with Bitbucket's own internal automatic
     sync schedule (`lastStartTime` values observed exactly ~30 minutes apart —
     `9:11 → 9:41 → 10:11 → 10:41`), not with any manual trigger. The servlet likely
     silently no-ops/throttles repeat requests with no way to tell from the response.

Building this into devops-api would report `"status": "successful"` on requests that almost
always silently did nothing — worse than not having the feature. `sync_user_directory`
therefore raises `HTTPException(501, ...)` unconditionally, without calling Bitbucket at all.
`GET /user-dirs` is unaffected and still works correctly (see above) — only the sync/trigger
side is unsupported. If Atlassian ever ships this (tracked publicly since 2014 in
[BSERV-5108](https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/BSERV-5108), still open as of this writing),
revisit this.

## Schema — `ProjectSpec`

| Field | Type | Constraints |
|---|---|---|
| `key` | `str` | required; `^[a-zA-Z0-9_\-]+$`; max 255 chars |
| `name` | `str` | required; `^[a-zA-Z0-9_\-]+$`; max 255 chars |
| `description` | `str` | required; max 1000 chars |
| `admin_user` | `Optional[str]` | `^[a-z0-9]+$`; max 15 chars |
| `admin_group` | `Optional[str]` | `^[a-zA-Z0-9_\-]+$`; max 255 chars |

Model validator: at least one of `admin_user` / `admin_group` must be provided.

## Config fields (`conf.py`)

| Field | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `BITBUCKET_ENDPOINT` | `/rest/api/latest` | Bitbucket REST API base path |
| `BITBUCKET_CROWD_ENDPOINT` | `/rest/crowd/latest` | Crowd REST API base path — used for user directory listing and sync |

Global credentials (`BITBUCKET_USERNAME`, `BITBUCKET_PASSWORD`) and `BITBUCKET_API_URL` live in `global_conf.py`.

## Local dev

```bash
docker compose -f ../docker-compose.bitbucket.yaml up -d
# Bitbucket at http://localhost:7990  user: admin  pass: 12345678
```

Set in `.env`:
```
BITBUCKET_API_URL=http://localhost:7990
BITBUCKET_USERNAME=admin
BITBUCKET_PASSWORD=12345678
```

## Testing

Tests mock the injected `bitbucket_client` via `MagicMock` / `AsyncMock`.  
`conftest.py` builds a throw-away `FastAPI` app with just the Bitbucket router.  
`POST /` triggers up to 3 calls: create (`post`) + user assign (`put`) + group assign (`put`).
